## Problem Statement
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading disease that has gained attention around the globe. The author's aim is to develop and deliver useful COVID-19 analytics for public use to combat and report the spread of COVID-19.

In this report, the author wishes to answer these questions which are listed as follows:

1. How's the current COVID-19 global statistics (total cases, new cases, total deaths, and total vaccination) at a glance?
1. How's the performance of countries compared to each other?
1. How's the COVID-19 vaccination distribution amongst countries?
1. What are some of the factors driving full vaccination rate?

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this report is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing. You can find the complete Our World in Data COVID-19 datasetâ€”together with a complete overview of the sources and more at its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/). The data you can find here includes:

- **Confirmed Cases and Deaths:** Data comes from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (JHU). The methodology for collection of this data is discussed [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The cases & deaths dataset is updated daily.
  - Note: confirmed cases and deaths are collected by Johns Hopkins University by date of report, rathen than date of test/death. Therefore the number they report on a given day does not necessarily represent the actual number on that date, because of the long reporting chain that exists between a new case/death and its inclusion in statistics. This also means that time series can show sudden changes (negative or positive) when a country corrects historical data, because it had previously under- or overestimated the number of cases/deaths.
- **Hospitalizations and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Admissions:** Data is collected from official sources and collated by Our World in Data. The complete list of country-by-country sources is available [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/hospitalizations/locations.csv).
- **Testing for COVID-19:** Data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports; you can find
further details in the [checklist of questions to understand testing
data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data), information on
[geographical and temporal
coverage](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for), and [detailed
country-by-country source information](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country). **On 23 June 2022, new datapoints were stopped being added to the COVID-19 testing dataset.** You can read more [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/discussions/2667).
- **Vaccinations Against COVID-19:** Data is collected by the _Our World in Data_ team from official reports.
- **Other Variables:** Data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Global Burden of Disease, Blavatnik School of Government, etc.). More information is available in [this codebook](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/owid-covid-codebook.csv).
